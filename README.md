## üìù Project Overview

The **IoT-Based Plant Disease Recognition System** is designed to help **farmers, gardeners, and researchers** detect plant diseases early. It combines **IoT hardware**, **web technologies**, and **AI-based image analysis** to automate plant health monitoring.

**Core Components**:

- **ESP32-CAM**: Captures real-time images of plant leaves.  
- **XAMPP Server (PHP/Apache)**: Stores images and hosts a web dashboard.  
- **Python AI Model (TensorFlow/Keras)**: Classifies plant diseases automatically.  
- **Web Dashboard**: Displays uploaded images and disease results interactively.

## ‚ö° Features

- Real-time leaf image capture with ESP32-CAM  
- Automatic image upload to local server using PHP  
- AI-based disease recognition via Python models  
- Interactive dashboard for monitoring plant health  
- Low-cost, scalable, and easy to deploy

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Components:

| Component        | Function |
|-----------------|---------|
| ESP32-CAM        | Captures high-resolution images of plant leaves |
| OV2640 Camera    | 2MP camera integrated with ESP32-CAM |
| XAMPP Server     | Receives images and hosts PHP web interface |
| Python AI Model  | Predicts disease type using ML models |
| Web Dashboard    | Displays images and disease analysis |

### Workflow:

1. ESP32-CAM captures leaf images.  
2. Images uploaded to `upload.php` on XAMPP server.  
3. Python script `analyze.py` predicts plant disease.  
4. Dashboard `index.php` displays results.
